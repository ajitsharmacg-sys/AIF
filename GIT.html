2. Add it to Bitbucket

Open Bitbucket in browser

Click Profile picture (top right)

Personal settings

SSH keys

Add key

Paste the key

Save

Important:
Add it under Personal SSH keys, not workspace keys.

3. Verify SSH agent is running (Windows)

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service ssh-agent
ssh-add $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa


You should see:

Identity added

4. Test again (this must succeed)
ssh -T git@bitbucket.org

Expected success output
authenticated via ssh key.
You can use git to connect to Bitbucket.


If you do NOT see this, cloning will never work.

5. Try cloning again
git clone git@bitbucket.org:canon-europe/itcg_azure_apps.git

6. If SSH works but clone still fails

Then it’s repo permission, not SSH.

Open this URL while logged in:

https://bitbucket.org/canon-europe/itcg_azure_apps


If you see Access denied → ask repo admin to add you

If you see the repo → clone will work

Fast unblock (temporary)

If you need the code immediately:

git clone https://bitbucket.org/canon-europe/itcg_azure_apps.git


Use:

Username: your Bitbucket username

Password: App password (not normal password)

Summary (clear)

SSH key exists

SSH connects

Key is not registered with Bitbucket OR repo access missing

Adding the key + permission fixes it

Once you add the key, reply with the output of:

ssh -T git@bitbucket.org


and I’ll confirm you’re fully unblocked.
